# SWE-bench task data

Dockerfile generator for the SWE-bench benchmark. This repo is just for the original SWE-bench benchmark and does not contain any data related to the newer benchmarks we released like SWE-bench Multilingual or SWE-bench Multimodal.

## Usage

```bash
# From HuggingFace dataset
dockerfile-gen

# From local JSON/JSONL file
dockerfile-gen

# Specific instances
dockerfile-gen
```

## Output

`Dockerfile` and `eval.sh` are regenerated in place under `tasks/<instance_id>/`, from that task's `task.yaml`.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```
